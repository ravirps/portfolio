# Hydration Mismatch Fixes

This document explains the hydration mismatch issues that were occurring in the Next.js application and the solutions implemented.

## Problem

The application was experiencing hydration mismatches due to:

1. **Browser Extensions**: Extensions like Testim were adding `data-testim-main-word-scripts-loaded="true"` attributes to the body element
2. **Client-side only components**: Components that render differently on server vs client
3. **Third-party scripts**: Google Tag Manager and other scripts that modify the DOM

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Body Element Hydration Suppression

Added `suppressHydrationWarning` to the body element in `app/layout.js`:

```jsx
<body className={inter.className} suppressHydrationWarning>
```

This prevents React from warning about hydration mismatches on the body element, which is commonly affected by browser extensions.

### 2. Custom Hydration Hooks

Created `app/hooks/useHydration.js` with two hooks:

- `useHydration()`: Returns both hydration and client state
- `useClientOnly()`: Returns whether the component has mounted on the client

### 3. Hydration-Safe Wrapper Component

Created `app/components/helper/hydration-safe.jsx`:

```jsx
export default function HydrationSafe({ children, fallback = null }) {
  const mounted = useClientOnly();
  
  if (!mounted) return fallback;
  return children;
}
```

### 4. Improved ClientGTM Component

Updated the Google Tag Manager component to use the new hydration hook:

```jsx
export default function ClientGTM() {
  const mounted = useClientOnly();
  
  if (!mounted) return null;
  
  return process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_GTM ? 
    <GoogleTagManager gtmId={process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_GTM} /> : null;
}
```

### 5. Main Page Hydration Safety

Wrapped the main page content in the HydrationSafe component to prevent mismatches from dynamically imported components.

## Best Practices

1. **Use `suppressHydrationWarning` sparingly**: Only on elements that are commonly modified by browser extensions
2. **Implement proper client-side checks**: Use hooks like `useClientOnly()` for components that need to render differently
3. **Dynamic imports with SSR disabled**: For components that rely on browser APIs
4. **Consistent fallbacks**: Provide appropriate fallback content during SSR

## Testing

To test the fixes:

1. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to different pages (especially `/biodata`)
3. Check browser console for hydration warnings
4. Test with browser extensions enabled/disabled

## Additional Notes

- The `data-testim-main-word-scripts-loaded` attribute is added by browser extensions and is not part of the application code
- These fixes ensure the application works correctly regardless of browser extension interference
- The solutions maintain SEO and performance while preventing hydration mismatches
